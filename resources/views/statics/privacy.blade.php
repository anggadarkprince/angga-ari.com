                    <h3>Privacy Statement</h3>
                    <p class="text-muted">This Privacy Statement is effective July 30, 2018.</p>
                    <p>
                        Orion is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals who visit the Company’s Web sites
                        (“Visitors”) and individuals who register to use the Services as defined below (“Customers”). This
                        Privacy Statement describes Orion’s Web site privacy practices in relation to the use of the
                        Company’s Web sites and the related applications and services offered by Orion (the “Services”).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our Privacy Notice describes what information we gather from our members and others who visit and
                        use our Properties, how we use that information, and what we do to protect it. By visiting or using
                        our Properties, you consent to the information handling practices described in this Privacy Notice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your use of our Properties and any information you provide on our Properties are subject to the
                        terms of this Privacy Notice, which is incorporated into and subject to our Terms of Service. Any
                        capitalized terms used but not defined within this Privacy Notice have the meaning given to them in
                        our Terms of Service.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Orion Privacy Principles</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our Privacy Notice is fueled by our commitment to the following Privacy Principles:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We’re deeply committed to creating a safe and secure online environment for you.</li>
                        <li>We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We established ourselves as a
                            not-for-profit organization so that our mission of education and your trust will not be in
                            conflict with a for-profit motive.
                        </li>
                        <li>We strive to provide you with access to and control over the information you give us, and we
                            take the protection of your information very seriously.
                        </li>
                        <li>We take extra precautions for our younger learners under the age of 13, including restricting
                            child accounts to automatically block features that would allow a child to post or disclose
                            personal information.
                        </li>
                        <li>We do not advertise on Orion. We use your information to provide you with a better
                            learning experience, not to sell you products.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>How we collect and use data</h4>
                    <p>
                        We take the information you provide to us very seriously, and we strive to put you in control of
                        decisions around your information. Orion collects the following information about you and
                        your use of our Properties:
                    </p>

                    <h5>Personal Information.</h5>
                    <p>
                        When you register for, browse and use our Properties, you may provide to Orion what is
                        generally called “personally identifiable information” or “personal data” (such as your full name,
                        email address, or a photograph of yourself) that can be used to identify you. At Orion, we
                        call this data “Personal Information”.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Information from Integrated Services like Facebook or Twitter.</h5>
                    <p>
                        If you decide to register through or otherwise grant access to a third-party social networking or
                        integrated service (what we call an “Integrated Service”), such as Facebook Connect or Google, Orion
                        Academy may also collect Personal Information that is already associated with your Integrated
                        Service account. You may also have the option of sharing additional information with Orion
                        through an Integrated Service. If you choose to provide such information, during registration or
                        otherwise, you are giving Orion the permission to use, share, and store it in a manner
                        consistent with this Privacy Notice.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Information about your use of our Properties and other User-provided Information.</h5>
                    <p>
                        We may collect usage information about your use of certain features on our Properties, such as the
                        number of problems you have attempted, the number of videos you have viewed, and the amount of time
                        spent to complete a problem. This enables us to better tailor educational experiences that are most
                        appropriate for you.
                    </p>


                    <h5>Information obtained from other Users.</h5>
                    <p>We make available certain features on our Properties that allow other Users to provide us information
                        about you. This information may include Personal Information. Generally, this occurs when parents or
                        teachers provide information relating to a Child User. For example, a parent may register an account
                        for their child and provide us with certain information, such as the Child’s User name and
                        birthday.</p>

                    <h5>Location Information.</h5>
                    <p>
                        We may collect and use information about your location (such as your country) to provide you with
                        tailored educational experiences for your region, but we don’t collect the precise geolocation of
                        you or your device. You may be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device to
                        prevent it from providing us with any location information.
                        Information from Other Sources.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In certain situations, we may obtain information, including Personal Information, from third parties
                        or sources other than our Properties. For example, if you donate to Orion via PayPal, we may
                        obtain your name and mailing address to send a thank you note, or if you apply for a job with Orion
                        Academy via an online recruiting site, we will obtain the information you provide in your
                        application for that purpose. If we combine or associate information from other sources with
                        Personal Information that we collect through our Properties, we will treat the combined information
                        as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Notice.
                    </p>

                    <h4>How we maintain data integrity</h4>
                    <h5>Data security is important to you, and to us.</h5>

                    <p>
                        To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before
                        granting you account access or making corrections to your information. For example, we may ask you
                        to provide certain Personal Information to confirm your identity, and we may require that you create
                        and use a password to access certain parts of our Properties. You should create and maintain a
                        strong password to help ensure the security of your account.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We try to ensure that our Properties and information sent to us are safe, but no security measures
                        are perfect.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Orion uses certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards designed to preserve the
                        integrity and security of your Personal Information and other information we maintain in connection
                        with our Properties. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any or all of the
                        information you transmit to Orion, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your
                        transmission of information, Orion makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the
                        security of our systems. When you enter sensitive information, we encrypt the transmission of that
                        information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or similar technologies. However, please note
                        that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or
                        destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
                    </p>

                    <h5>
                        We will notify you electronically or via the Properties if Orion experiences a data security
                        incident that could affect you.
                    </h5>

                    <p>
                        If we learn of a data security incident that compromises or appears to compromise your Personal
                        Information, then we will attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate
                        protective steps. We may also post a notice on our Properties if a data security incident
                        occurs.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Data Security</h4>
                    <p>
                        At Orion, we only use Personal Information as needed for the purposes for which it was
                        collected or where you have consented to our use of Personal Information relating to you. We take
                        reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Information we store and use is accurate, complete, and
                        up-to-date. If you discover that Personal Information or other data pertaining to you is inaccurate,
                        incomplete, or out-of-date, please update your account information or contact us as outlined below.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Links to other sites </h4>
                    <p>
                        The Properties may link to and may be linked by websites operated by other entities or individuals.
                        Some of these websites, such as the Orion Facebook page, may be co-branded with our name or
                        logo. This Privacy Notice does not apply to, and we cannot always control the activities of, such
                        other third-party websites. You should consult the respective privacy policies of those third-party
                        websites.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice </h4>
                    <p>
                        Orion may modify or revise this Privacy Notice from time to time. Orion will notify
                        Users of any changes to our Privacy Notice by posting the revised Privacy Notice with an updated
                        date of revision on our Properties, along with a short notice of the revision posted on our
                        homepage. We will not change how we use any Personal Information in any material way without also
                        providing notice of the change via email to you (or in the case of a Child User, to your Parent) or
                        through the Properties, and obtaining consent to any new uses.
                    </p>
